# FlickrFlow

An android app that tracks your walk with images every 100 meters: 
- images fetched from Flickr based on location 
- pictures are shown in a list, and user can scroll through the stream
- one button start/stop, on each start the previous stream of photos gets wiped

### MVVM pattern with Clean architecture (as much as possible) developed with Kotlin.
Clean architecture consists of three layers:
- **Data**, which includes databases, clients, repositories, network
- **Domain**, which includes models, entities, and usecases
- **Presentation**, which includes UI related components, such as ViewModels, Fragments, Activities
